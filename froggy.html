<p>Hello. Once again allow me to welcome you to my frogtastic personal webpage. I do a lot of things, most of them are boring and can be viewed in the curriculum vitae seen at the bottom of the page. I've put a few of the not boring things I'm interested in in a bulleted list below:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Frogs</li>
  <li>The French Revolution</li>
  <li>Looking for fossils in the woods</li>
  <li>Gardening</li>
</ul>
<p> I'm a big fan of frogs, are you? </p>
