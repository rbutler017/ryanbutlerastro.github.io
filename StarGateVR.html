    <h1>StarGateVR</h1>


<p> StarGateVR is a tool developed for viewing and manipulating Gaia data on Meta Quest 2 headsets. The Gaia spacecraft has done an excellent job collecting 3-dimensional positional and velocity information (among other insightful properties) of a great number of stars. One should be able to imagine without too much difficulty how it would be powerful to view that information in a 3-dimensional way, as allowed by virtual reality. Hence the power of StarGateVR. </p>

<p> In addition to allowing one to view Gaia catalogue stars in a variety of 3-dimensional spaces (velocity, positional, etc.) StarGateVR also allows the user to do data filtration within the tool. This is done with the use of an adjustable ellipsoidal filtering tool, known as a gate, which the user can drag and drop over groups of stars to highlight and segregate them out of the main field. These stars remain highlighted as the user switches coordinate axes, allowing for multiple steps of filtering to occur in program. The tool also allows for easy export of csv files containing the gated data. </p>

<p> At present StarGateVR can handle Gaia querries of up to ~700,000 stars fairly comfortably. In recent history StarGateVR has been used in project such as:
<ul>
<li> Identifying members of nearby young moving groups </li>
<li> Evaluating membership of open clusters </li>
<li> Examining stellar populations at different galactic scale heights </li>
<li> Verifying the chemical composition of open clusters

</ul>

<p>Beyond targeted scientific aims, it provides a great data visualization tool for the Gaia catalogue, and has educational potential that is currently under exploration.</p>

<p>I have taken the time to produce a series of tutorial videos demonstating the key features of the program (as of version 0.5.4). The program is under active development, so some details shown are subject to change, but the fundamentals will remain approximately the same in the future. You can see these videos below: </p>
